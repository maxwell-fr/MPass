# MPass Project
A library and template-fill utility for generating passphrases that fit specific criteria.

## MPass
MPass is a library that contains all functions and objects needed to generate the passphrases.

Intended to be extensible, it is somewhat overwrought for its (seemingly) simple goals. Like most other projects it also serves as learning and practice for various techniques and methodologies.

## MPassDemo
MPassDemo is an AvaloniaUI application that leverages MPass.
